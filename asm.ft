\ we can now create codewords from goforth

\ this is equivalent to the 'next' macro in goforth.dasm

\ this works like does>, but for assembly
\ it terminates the word definition so no need for ";" afterwards
\ the assembled code just follows in memory
\ and the generated words point to that code in their xt
